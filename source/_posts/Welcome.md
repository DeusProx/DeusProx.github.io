## Hello!
This is Gordon Lawrenz and I'm an computer science student(M.Sc.) at the [RWTH Aachen](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/). In Github I'm also known as [DeusProx](https://github.com/DeusProx)!

This blog will help me documentate my work, projects and other parts of my life.
It is also hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) under this [repository](https://github.com/DeusProx/DeusProx.github.io).

I hope you enjoy it!
